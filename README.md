# Data Engineer Portfolio Project

##Subscriber-pipeline-starter-kit

In this project I have created a bash + python pipeline to regularly transform a messy SQLite database into a clean source of truth for an analytics team.
The pipeline
-performs unit tests to confirm data validity
-writes human-readable errors to an error log
-automatically checks and updates changelogs
-updates a production database with new clean data

##Features

-Python
-Pandas
-SQLite
-Numpy
